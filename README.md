Basic Banking System
here, i was given a task where i had to create a basic banking system such that it contains ten dummy IDs with information about their name, email address, phone number, amount present in the account. 
next i had to create option for money transaction where i had to select name of the sender, reciever, and the amount that i want to send. after clicking on submit option, the amount gets deducted from the amount column of sender and it shows the amount remaining and in reciever's amount column, it shows the total amount after adding the sent amount.
also, i created a transaction table which shows name of sender, reciever, and the transacted amount.
i used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL for this project.
